A birth doula is a trained professional who provides continuous physical, emotional, and informational support to a mother before, during, and shortly after childbirth. Unlike medical professionals, doulas do not perform clinical tasks like checking blood pressure or fetal heart rates. Instead, they focus on the holistic well-being of the mother.

Before labor, a doula helps the mother prepare for childbirth by discussing birth plans, providing information on what to expect, and offering techniques for pain management and relaxation. During labor, the doula offers comfort through methods such as massage, breathing exercises, and positioning. They also provide emotional reassurance and act as an advocate for the motherâ€™s wishes, facilitating communication with medical staff.

After the birth, a doula continues to support the mother by assisting with breastfeeding, offering guidance on newborn care, and providing emotional support during the postpartum period. The presence of a doula has been associated with shorter labor, reduced need for pain relief, and a more positive birth experience overall.

In essence, a birth doula is a dedicated companion who helps ensure that the mother feels supported, informed, and empowered throughout the childbirth journey.
