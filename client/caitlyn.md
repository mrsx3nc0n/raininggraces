*I had the privilege of having Robin as one of my doulas during my daughter’s birth, and I can’t express enough how invaluable her support was during my labor. Not only did she provide the most incredible back massages, which brought immense relief, but her unwavering encouragement and presence were a true lifeline through one of the toughest experiences of my life. Robin’s compassionate and skilled care made a world of difference, and I’m deeply grateful for everything she did to support me and help me navigate this challenging journey.*
