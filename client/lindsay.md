*We were BLESSED to have Robin join our doula team for the birth of our fourth child! His birth was difficult and Robin provided a strong, reassuring presence during labor, delivery, and in the immediate postpartum time. Our sweet son had to be taken to the NICU for extra support and Robin was such a great comfort to me (Momma) while that transition occurred. We are so grateful to God that He saw fit to have Robin join us on this journey and we feel blessed by her commitment to her role as doula. She is just wonderful and we love her!! Thank you, Robin!*
