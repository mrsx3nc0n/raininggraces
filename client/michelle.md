*Robin was exactly who I needed by my side as I delivered my second child. It was an unplanned induction and a stressful labor due to fetal distress. Robin was so calm through it all, talking me through everything and allowing me to CRUSH her hand during each contraction. Her calm, steady presence was so helpful and I am beyond thankful for her support and guidance. She is amazing!*
