*I had the honor to have Robin as my Doula for the birth of my second baby. Having her by my side providing comfort, reassurance, massages and advice through my long and difficult labor was invaluable. I truly couldn’t have had the outcome of my delivery without her, and even though things didn’t go as planned, Robin was right there supporting every decision. I’m so grateful for her and her guidance. Her calming and nurturing presence during my labor helped me beyond measure. We love you, Robin!*
